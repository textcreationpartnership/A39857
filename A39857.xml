            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>WHen firſt our Poet gave his Mind to write,</l>
               <l>He freely owns he had no Muſe, but ſpite</l>
               <l>To ſee his Native Country men oppreſt,</l>
               <l>By clumſy Prieſts that ſeem'd to be in jeſt,</l>
               <l>Even then when Nature ſtrove to do her beſt.</l>
               <l>Thence his juſt Indignation higher roſe,</l>
               <l>Venting himſelf in this Satyrick Proſe,</l>
               <l>As might their Follies and their Crimes oppoſe.</l>
               <l>Yet his ſoft hand deſigns no mortal Wound,</l>
               <l>Nor would he touch on any part that's ſound.</l>
               <l>The Innocent are from his Darts ſecure,</l>
               <l>And the Infected he deſigns to cure.</l>
               <l>Beſides—</l>
               <l>He was ambitious to preſent to view,</l>
               <l>Something that might deſerve the Name of New.</l>
               <l>Fopling he thought ſo long had trod the Stage,</l>
               <l>He ſeem'd to have outliv'd <hi>Methuſalem</hi>'s Age.</l>
               <l>And though in various Dreſſes he appears,</l>
               <l>His various Dreſſes cannot hide his Years.</l>
               <l>His Charms grow old, and can delight no more</l>
               <l>The ſhining Sex, that he oblig'd before;</l>
               <l>The Bawd, the Punk, the Souldier, and the Cit,</l>
               <l>The Man of Breeding, and the Man of Wit,</l>
               <l>With dull repeated Humours clog the Pit:</l>
               <l>The Bully, Cully, and the Country Squire;</l>
               <l>The Engliſh Vicar, and the Spaniſh Friar,</l>
               <l>Though he, they ſay, has lately quitted Station,</l>
               <l>And publickly has made a Recantation.</l>
               <l>All theſe, by turns, have on the Stage appear'd,</l>
               <l>And thought it there no ſcandal to be jear'd.</l>
               <l>None but the Plotting Prieſt did ſneak away</l>
               <l>Behind the Scenes, and there ſecurely lay,</l>
               <l>'Till our bold Poet drew him into light,</l>
               <l>And here preſents him naked to your ſight.</l>

               <l>Zounds, the dull Rogue has left us in the lurch,</l>
               <l>Promis'd a Play, and brought us to a Church,</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:98218:3"/>
               <l>To ſee a Race of mumbling Bald-pate Friars,</l>
               <l>And heard (what need not) Jeſuits prov'd Lyars:</l>
               <l>And 'ſtead of the gay Humours of the Town,</l>
               <l>Preſents the Follies of the lazy Gown:</l>

                     <p>Aye, Faith, and good Advice too. Thou muſt be ſure to deal with the Fathers as ſome Gallants do with vicious Women that ſtand upon their Reputation; thou muſt pry into all their Secrets, and then they will faithfully ſerve thee, as the <hi>Indians</hi> do the Devil, not out of Love but Fear. Whenever they caſt out a Devil by Compact with the pretended poſſeſſed Perſon, Do thou be one of the Witneſſes, and take care to have an hand in the buſineſs. Whenever they make an Image ſpeak, or a Relick cure one that never was ſick; do thou be one that ſtands behind the Curtain, or that applies the Remedy, or ſubſcribes to the truth of the Miracle. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they deviſe a new way to deſtroy Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks by the gentle methods of Fire and Sword; do thou be one of their Conſederates, and promiſe to be a principal Actor in the Tragedy.

                     <p>'Tis well, <hi>Jack,</hi> if thou doſt, for they are the moſt profitable Secrets of any.

In remote Countries they do not much value their Reputation; yet here where they are bound to their good Behaviour (which ſome of them like worſe than to be bound to a Whipping-Poſt) they muſt dread them that know their Secrets, leſt the Diſcovery ſhould hinder their grand Projection.</p>

He is the rareſt Contriver in the World, he has ten thouſand Plots in his Head, the leaſt of which are ſufficient to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn a better ſettled Government than this. He has refin'd the Politicks of all the Courts in Chriſtendom for the uſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And tho he be a Foreigner by Birth, he is ſo converſant in the Manners of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> you would ſwear he had been born here.</p>

He ſeems to be too great an Admirer of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which makes his Converſation naufeous to others by the continual Commendation of himſelf, and is prejudicial to his Plots, by robbing him of the Advice and the Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Friends. Beſides, he is too bold in making uſe of Foreign Foreign Policies in their Courts, which for the moſt part, like Trees tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from far diſtant Soiles, tho the Fruits there were pleaſant, yet here they are harſh and crabbed.</p>

                     <p>But I ſeeing the impending Danger, immediately ſtep'd in: My Lord, ſaid I, (with ſubmiſſion to your Lordſhip's better Underſtanding) that you do not rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what a kind of Man Mr. <hi>Turnabout</hi> is: Alas! ſaid I, he is none of thoſe ſelfiſh Worldlings that expect Places and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Reward, and under pretence of furthering the Catholick Intereſt, ſeek the Promotion of their own Ends—No, No;—your Lordſhip may find enough of ſuch baſe Creatures to allure with Places. But, ſaid I, as for Mr. <hi>Turnabout,</hi> his Thoughts are fix'd upon things of a ſublimer Nature: It would be the utmoſt degree of Savage Barbarity, to rob him of thoſe precious Minutes which he employs in far more noble Exerciſes. Alas! ſaid I, my Lord, Mr. <hi>Turnabout</hi> aims at no Honour, but that of being a Saint in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Kalendar. He knows no Arithmetick, but that of telling his Beads: He ſtudies no Complements, but thoſe that are given to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Saints in the Miſſal: He cares for no Employment, but that of advancing the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Cauſe <hi>gratis</hi>—Now, my Lord, ſaid I, What an inhuman thing would it be to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98218:7"/> thruſt a Man of his Seraphick Temper, into ſo great a ſecular Encumbrance, where he muſt be loaded with fulſome Titles of Honour, where, inſtead of telling over his Beads, he muſt be counting great Sums of Mony, and receive Viſits from every Earl and Baron. And which is yet worſt of all, where the Glory of his generoſity of ſerving the Cauſe <hi>gratis</hi> will be eclips'd, by receiving a viſible Reward. This is ſuch a Cruelty, as ought not to be uſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſo good and religious a Man—</p>

                     <p>Heavens defend my Innocence! Was ever Man ſo miſtaken? If a Woman fall into a Swoon, may I not take her up? if her Breaſts beat high with Paſſion, may not I innocently lay my hands upon them to keep 'em down? If ſhe is overwhelm'd with Sorrow, may not I give her two or three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving Kiſſes, but you muſt preſently ſuſpect me of Obſcenity?</p>

Never enter into Diſpute but when you are ſure that the Perſon
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98218:11"/> for whoſe ſake you appoint the Conference will declare in favour of your ſide: for he that carries away the Prize right or wrong, will always be thought to obtain the Victory.

Above all things, have a care that you tie not up your ſelves to the ſtrict Rules of Senſe and Reaſon; for that hinders multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of words, and is extreamly prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to our Cauſe—obſerve theſe three Proviſo's, and then diſpute as often as you pleaſe—</p>

                     <p>I wonder your Lordſhip can think that any Proceedings againſt a few obſtinate Black-coats ſhould create any diſturbance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt either the Gentry or Commons of this Land! Did your Lordſhip ever perceive that the Gentry were ever better pleas'd with a Play, than when the poor Parſon was jeer'd? or the Clowns ever more rejoyce, than when the Vicar was ruin'd? Alas! my Lord, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd this violent Perſecution of the Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats for the general Satisfaction of the whole Kingdom.</p>

                     <p>Good, my Lord, take no care for that, I have abundance of Charity for the Villains, tho they don't deſerve it, and have care of them. Some of them have good Pallates and love their Bellies: We will ſend for <hi>Fr.</hi> Men to inſtruct them in the Art of Cookery, and then they may keep from ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, by licking their Fingers. Some of them have good Voices and are very muſical, they ſhall be licens'd to ſing Ballads, or cry Fagots, which may be a good Trade if burning of Hereticks come again in faſhion. Others have a right habit of cringing, flattering, fawning, bowing, lying for Court-Preferment, and thoſe will be ſure to live, provided you don't cut out their Tongues, or thruſt a Stake into their back-ſides to hinder their Courteſy. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (as a punning Friend of mine was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to phraſe it) in all Changes of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have been good <hi>Trimmers,</hi> and thoſe we will put out to Barbers.

Our Friend <hi>Mackdonnel</hi> came to me this Morning, and told me a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Story, How ſome of the Heretick Divines did baffle our Emiſſaries at a Publick Coffee-Houſe. Wherefore I conſidering with my ſelf the Caſualties of theſe Spiritual Wars, wherein the Succeſs does not depend upon the Goodneſs of the Cauſe, but the Strength and Management of the Combatants, have found out a certain way to Victory, unleſs you are deficient to your ſelves.</p>

                     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
                     <p>Look you—thus it muſt be—One of you muſt put on the Habit of an Heretical Clergy-man, and repair to ſome Coffee-Houſe, at ſuch time as 'tis moſt uſually crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Company. Then muſt he inſult and brag in ſo high a Tone, as may draw the Eyes and Ears of all the Company that way, Then another muſt put on the Habit of a Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, and ſit there demurely a good while. Then muſt the Mechanick enter into Diſpute with the Gown and Caſſock, the Gown and Caſſock muſt yield, and formally acknowledg his Error.</p>

                     <p>Your Information I ſhall hear moſt gladly. But before you begin, I will tell you my Character, and that perhaps may ſave you the labour of proceeding further. I am old, but not infected with the uſual Humours of Old Age. I am not credulous, for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve none (eſpecially Prieſts) upon their bare word. If you bring no further proof than that, you will loſe your Cauſe in my Court of Juſtice. I am not timerous, and therefore you may ſpare all flouriſhing Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of Danger, for there is no Danger that I dare not meet, or that can ſeem greater to me than it really is. I am neither ſtupid or forgetful; therefore if you have ſent this Paper, or come your ſelf to impoſe upon me, you ſhall find that I have not forgot the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of remembring Injuries. I am neither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately Covetous, nor dotingly Prodigal. I requite Courteſies moderately in my Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, but ſhall never (like ſome old Children) leave an Eſtate to them that feed me with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-Plums, or buy me Play-things. But I have one Imperfection of old Age, I am very peeviſh when I hear Impertinencies; which praying you to avoid, I hope you will begin your Story—</p>

                     <p>Gentlemen, I will open the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Caſe of young Mr. <hi>Subtleman</hi> thus:—In all moral actions, we muſt conſider the Good and Evil that attend them, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly conſider which does outweigh the other: Let us apply then this Rule to our preſent Caſe, and ſee what Good and what Evil is likely to enſue the removal of this ancient Gentleman.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>All.</speaker>
                     <p>A good method.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Big.</speaker>
                     <p>As for the good, that is great and Viſible: For, firſt, hereupon a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of known Parts and Integrity will immediately declare for the Catholick
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98218:20"/> Church;—which I eſteem to be worth to the Publick at leaſt <hi>1000l.</hi>—Then here's an Eſtate of <hi>4000l. per annum</hi> plac'd in the hands of one that will beſtow it upon Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Uſes:—Valuing which but at twelve years purchaſe, amounts to <hi>48000l.</hi>—Then here are Lectures againſt Popery prevented, (for the old Gentleman has threatned to ſettle part of his Eſtate for that uſe), the avoiding which, I ſuppoſe, may be valued at <hi>2000l.</hi> more.—This amounts in all to <hi>50000l.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Big.</speaker>
                     <p>Now let us take a brief view of the Evil or Miſchief in this action.—Firſt, here is a Gentleman removed out of the way, that was likely to enjoy an Eſtate of <hi>4000l. per annum</hi> for about three years, and that is worth <hi>12000l.</hi> But becauſe he is decrepit, and cannot have the free uſe of Women, Wine, and other Diverſions, the moſt it can amount to is <hi>1000l.</hi>
                     </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Big.</speaker>
                     <p>Then here are ſome innocent Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wrong'd of ſome trifling Legacies;—which we will eſteem, tho dearly, at <hi>3000l.</hi> Then there is the Charges of getting the work done, which in <hi>Italy</hi> I ſhould value but at Half-a-Crown: but ſuch Villains being dearer here than in Catholick Countries, it may coſt <hi>20l.</hi> The Penances for expiation of the Crime I value at <hi>100l.</hi> tho there were good times when ſuch things might be done cheaper.—So that the whole damage of ſuch an action amounts but to <hi>5200l.</hi> and what proportion does that bear to <hi>50000l.?</hi>

                     <p>My Brother ſpeaks well, but not all that may be ſaid on this Subject:—For in Murther two things are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; 1. the Act of killing, and 2. the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Now it is plain that the Immorality of Murther does not conſiſt in meer killing, for then every Executioner or Soldier would be guilty of Murther: but it is the evil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious intention of the mind that is all in all. Now if Mr. <hi>Subtleman</hi> bear no malice to his Father, but does that Work in a ſpirit of Love and Charity for the good of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Cauſe, there can be no evil in it; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he gives all the Eſtate that accrues thereby, to the Church, to ſhew that therein he was not acted by a ſpirit of Covetouſneſs.</p>

                     <p>My Brother ſpeaks well, but I muſt add this:—That as to kill a man (yea a Parent) with a charitable intention is certainly lawful; ſo to kill an Heretick, an inveterate obſtinate Heretick, is more than lawful, it is highly meritorious: They are condemn'd by the Laws Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, and any man may be their Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

                     <p>What my Reverend Brethren have ſaid in this Caſe, is undoubtedly true; but, for the Gentleman's ſatisfaction, I will prove the lawfulneſs of the Fact by an infallible Demonſtration.—Suppoſe it thus:—Young Mr. <hi>Subtleman</hi> takes up an Hammer, and knocks out the Brains of his aged Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:—<hi>Quaere,</hi> If this Action be in it ſelf unlawful?—I anſwer, No;—For if there be no unlawfulneſs in any part of this Action, then there is none in the whole—But there is no unlawfulneſs either in taking up the Hammer, or lifting the Hammer, or letting down the Hammer; <hi>Ergo,</hi> There is none in knocking out the old man's Brains.</p>

                     <p>Why look ye, Brethren, ye have left me little to ſay, but only this:—If there be any evil in ſuch a Murther, it conſiſts in the Injury that is done to the murdered perſon; and an Injury, is ſome part of Injuſtice done to man againſt his will, <hi>(Volenti non fit inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria);</hi> If therefore there could be a way found to ſend the Gentleman into another world with his own conſent, there could be no ſcruple in it.</p>

Then, in the ſecond place, I made my Will not ſo much for his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but becauſe I heard thee with mine own ears contriving my death; ſo that I being the Evidence, thou muſt invalidate my Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, by proving me a Rogue, and a Raſcal, and a Thief, or thou canſt not ſpeak to the purpoſe.</p>

I ſaid, indeed, That I had not ſeen my Man ſince laſt Night, and there is truth you ſee in that, for the Perſon that you took for my Man, confeſſes her ſelf a Woman.</p>

                     <speaker>Cau.</speaker>
                     <p>Then again, I ſaid, That I had not ſeen my Man ſince laſt Night, that is, I had not ſeen him with an Intention to tell you of it; ſo there is no falſhood in theſe words, only I did not expreſs my Mind quite ſo full as I might have done.—</p>

                     <p>Nay, my Brother is right in that.—His only fault was, that he did not expreſs his mind fully.</p>

                     <speaker>Cau</speaker>
                     <p>Then again,—pray obſerve the words of my Affirmation.—I told you, that I had not ſeen my Man ſince laſt Night, and pray, how ſhould I? Can I make a Man? Or can a Man be properly ſaid to be mine? A Servant may be mine, but a Man cannot. And now, pray, reflect how unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ye have charged me with the Crime of Lying, and repent of it.</p>

                     <p>Your Reverence miſtakes me—I am as great a ſtranger to fear as your ſelf; but ſtill I do not love to extinguiſh all ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal apprehenſions of danger: Divided num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are not of the ſtrength that united are, where the quantity is equal; but you do not well conclude from thence, That they are of no ſtrength at all: There are Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of divided Sand, that can reſiſt the ſtroke of a Cannon, and overwhelm the beſt diſciplin'd Troop in <hi>Europe:</hi> And tho I ſhould not fear a ſingle Enemy, if I had his Sword in my hand; yet I ſhould think my ſelf in an ill condition, if I were aſſaulted by two or three hundred naked men of equal ſtrength and courage with my ſelf.—This is our caſe;—We have 200 to one againſt us, and that ſeems to me to out-ballance all other Advantages—</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
                     <p>That is becauſe your Lordſhip has not conſidered the Policy of foreign Courts, as I have done. What vaſt numbers do they keep in Slavery, grievous inſupportable Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, by little or no force at all!—</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>L. <hi>Britt.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>That is, becauſe the People love to keep themſelves ſo, which our Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do not: Whether they are born Slaves by ſome peculiar Influence of the Heavens, or whether Cuſtom has made that Yoke to be eaſie, or whether that ſervile diſpoſition is deriv'd from Father to Son, by ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceivable manner of Tradition;—the Cauſe is uncertain, but the Effect is plain.—But to think <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men to be eaſily kept in ſubjection, becauſe foreigners can, is as good Logick, as to conclude a Lion dares not fight, becauſe a Sheep is a timorous Creature.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
                     <p>I perceive your Lordſhip is not skill'd in the Politicks; I can give you ſeveral rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why there is no danger in the dreaded number of the Hereticks: For firſt, they want an Head; and what, alas! is Body without an Head? There's one for you.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Your Argument is Metaphorical, but not concluſive.—It is true, theſe popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Inſurrections that are rais'd by the Power or Intereſt of one particular Man, are ſoon quell'd, when the Head is once remov'd; for the Cauſe taken away, the Effect ceaſes. But where the cauſe of diſcontent is general, an Head is never wanting, for many hands make light work.</p>

                     <p>Then again'—The Hereticks want Councel and Conduct: Alas! all their Great Men are bred in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, and know nothing of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Fineſſes: There are no men in the world, excepting thoſe of my Order, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the true Methods and Principles of

Alas! your <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords are troubled with ſcruples of Conſcience, and pretend to tenderneſs and good nature, and think themſelves always oblig'd to ſtick to the immutable Rules of Honour; and talk of Juſt and Unjuſt, and I know not what whimſeys: They don't conſider, that it is impoſſible for a States-man to accompliſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Deſigns, that boggles at any ſort of means that are conducing to his End, tho never ſo unjuſt and cruel.—</p>

                     <p>My Lord, I can never enough reflect upon the baſeneſs and ingratitude of thoſe Prieſts towards your Lordſhip and other worthy Patriots: but I am fill'd with horror and amazement, that a Perſon of your Worth, Courage, Conduct and Fidelity, ſhould be undermin'd by ſuch a raskally Crew of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical Prieſts as <hi>Politico, Bigot, Cautious,</hi> and <hi>Mackdonnel!</hi> a Gang of whimſical, nonſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Blockheads, that look as odly in the Court, as a Skull in the Preſence-Chamber; whoſe whole skill lies in Books, and that too no farther than Title-pages; and perhaps, if ſome ſpecial Roguery does require it, they may proceed to the Index, and ſo begin that, as they do all other things, at the wrong end. And—</p>

                     <p>Nay, good Lady, proceed no farther; I forgive my Enemies; and you know my buſineſs here is Love, and not Revenge.—Now muſt I hear my ſelf rail'd at, and ſay nothing.</p>

                     <p>I know he eſteems himſelf ſo, but the world has a different Opinion of him.

                     <p>Be not dejected, this Blanketting is a lively repreſentation of Great mens Fortunes, ſometimes up and ſometimes down; There is never any great Exaltation, but there is danger of a ſudden Depreſſion; this you knew before to be true by Speculation, and now receive a confirmation from palpable Experience.</p>

The ſtock was rude, but the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem is good and uſeful.</p>
